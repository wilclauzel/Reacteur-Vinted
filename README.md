## General info

This project, carried out as part of the [Le Reacteur](https://www.lereacteur.io/) training, aims to put into practice our knowledge in React on the backend part.

The Vinted Clone project is composed of 2 parts the frontend and the backend (application treated here).
The latter exposes APIs (used by the frontend) and extracts or stores data in a `MongoDB` database.

This project, with a pedagogical aim, should allow us to put forward our knowledge to employers.

## Overview

This application manages 3 categories of data with simplified models to manage the required functionalities :

- `User` : 2 APIs allow to create a new user (with an image) and to authenticate him. A third route allows to reset the password with a random value sent by mail (with `Mail gun`).

- `Offer`: 5 APIs allow to process offers from their creation (with management of 5 images) to their consultation: creation, modification, deletion and detail of an offer and global list of offers.

- `Payment`: 1 API allows you to buy an offer by making a bank payment (with `Stripe`).

The images are stored in `Cloudinary`.

## Features
